The end of October brings an end to softwear explorations (for the moment), and I've been preparing a small exhibition in the Library of my school, KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The exhibit will be up for a few weeks, and it will include some knitted pieces and a *collectively curated collection* of small artifacts and prints.

Here's where I need your participation! I'd like to add your own objects to the exhibit. It will end up looking like something below, on display in a glass box (no touching, so it's corona safe) and will be up for a few weeks starting October 26th.

I'm looking for any object that has to do with **software and knitting**.
But also close to
*hardware / computation / textiles / weaving / circuits / patterns / cables / threads / sequences / algorithms / code*

Objects might be:
* punchcards, objects that resemble or use punchcards (for example a music box)
* tools, such as knitting needles, machine parts
* books, printed patterns, photographs
* swatches, knitted items, yarns, threads
* vintage electronics, devices
* poems, drawings, schematics

If you'd like to contribute, please [email me](mailto:ncampowoytuk@gmail.com) or reach out on social media. I can come pick up your items in Stockholm.

Thank you! ðŸ¦•
