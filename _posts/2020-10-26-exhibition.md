Through different works of knitted software art the “Softwear” exhibition sheds light on the shared nature and historical connection between software and knitting. In three artworks made with software and a knitting machine, code and yarn come together to blur the boundaries between what is soft and what is hard, challenging the gendered associations of both computing and textile. The artworks build on feminist theories and curious encounters with technology, and ask the viewer to look for patterns and deviations of ones and zeros, repetition, symmetry, randomness, and manual embodied labour. By deeply entangling software and knitting, the exhibition seeks to demystify the pasts, presents and futures of computer science, making the field more approachable to those who have been historically pushed away.

The pieces in this exhibition have been knitted in cotton yarn using a Silver Reed SK840 knitting machine and DesignAKnit software. The code that generates the patterns was written in Javascript, using the open-source library p5.js. The piece “Ada’s Sol” uses Java and Processing.
